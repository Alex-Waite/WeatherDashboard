# WeatherDashboard
This application allows the user to search a city or chose from set preset cities and view the current weather and the weather forecast for the next 5 days so they may plan their activities accordingly
Here is a link to the application: https://alex-waite.github.io/WeatherDashboard/ and below is a screenshot of it

# Issues that i am aware of:
Searching for a new city does not create a new button for that city - I had this fucntion working well and i am not sure why it doesnt any more
<br>
UV Index query does not return a UV index - i am unsure on how to feed information obtained from one query into another query url when they are in seperate functions
